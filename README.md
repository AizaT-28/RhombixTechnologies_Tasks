# Cat vs Dog Image Recognition System 🐱🐶

## Project Description
This project is an Image Recognition System using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
built with TensorFlow and Keras. It classifies images into cats or dogs.

---

## Project Files

- `image_recognition.ipynb` → Colab notebook with all code to train and test the model.
- `dataset/` → Folder with your images (optional: small sample only).
- `README.md` → Project documentation.

## Instructions to Run

1. Open `image_recognition.ipynb` in Google Colab.
2. Upload your dataset into the `dataset/` folder (or sample dataset provided).
3. Run all notebook cells. The CNN model will be trained automatically.
4. After training, the model is saved as `cat_dog_cnn_model.keras` in Colab.

> Note: If your dataset is large, only include a small sample or provide instructions for the mentor to use their own dataset.
